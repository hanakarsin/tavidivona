In one round, host <a href=#>Steve Harvey</a> asked, “What was the biggest mistake you made at your wedding?” To which Timothy answered, “Saying ‘I do.'” And while he was quick to suggest that the answer didn't reflect his personal feelings, the remark may now be unsettling given Timothy’s conviction.
