The article seemed controversial because Jordan has always been a Republican.</li><li>On June 22, 2017, the MSNBC political analyst <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">warned GOP lawmakers</a> that defending President Trump would be like "hugging a suicide bomber." She made those comments after President Trump revealed in his tweets he did not have any tapes of his conversations with FBI Director James Comey.</li><li>On February 11, 2019, Steve Schmidt <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">threatened legal action</a> against the Words Matter Podcast if they released an episode where he stormed off. Elise had challenged him on why he had decided to work with his competitor Schultz. Schmidt accused the producers of having hijacked the show from him.</li><li>On April 17, 2019, several publications accused Elise of having an altered view of gay history. During her segment on Morning Joe, she described Pete Buttigieg and his sexual orientation by saying, “it is not his story. It is a side note to who he is.” The political analyst also went further to say being gay “should not be an issue.” Many people saw her views as twisted since Buttigieg has never indicated that his sexual orientation is a side note. Instead, he has accepted it and embraced his husband.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a9c83be9af6879ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sofia Richie bio: net worth, photos, boyfriend, Instagram, age</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite being a Republican, Elise has said and written both negative and positive things about the party and President Trump. But it is her cyclical views on Donald Trump that make his supporters feel offended at times. Many see her political opinions on the party and the president as more conservative because they are favouring the Democrats.</p><h2>What is Elise Jordan worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Elise Jordan has been working since she was 18 years. She has worked for the US government in her position as a speechwriter and has also published many articles for different publications.
