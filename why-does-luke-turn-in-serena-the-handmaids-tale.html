Unfortunately, <a href=#>Luke</a> doesn't know any of this when June calls him from the hospital to let him know she's alive. So when he calls authorities on <a href=#>Serena</a>, effectively separating her from her baby, Luke feels pretty good about himself.</p><p>But why, exactly, did Luke turn in Serena on The Handmaid's Tale? He has said before how helpless he feels when it comes to June and Hannah. He only just got June back, after all. June has sacrificed plenty, while Luke has little idea what it means to be trapped in Gilead. Is this his warped way of making it up to her?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span><p>Yvonne Strahovski as Serena and Elisabeth Moss as June in 'The Handmaid's Tale.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Serena and June aren't exactly friends now.</h2><p>It's June who convinces Serena to go to the hospital after she delivers her baby in a barn. June realizes she doesn't want to kill Serena or her son, as she previously threatened, and they actually find common ground in talking about raising their children to be good people. Even so, when Serena suggests in the barn that June take her son and raise him, June isn't into the idea of helping Serena out that much.</p><p>But, it seems, they've turned a corner. Serena even apologizes to June for her mistreatment of her in Gilead. It's still too soon to say if Serena might eventually help June in her quest to take down and dismantle Gilead for the safety of women and children. However, Serena and June have never been closer to some kind of understanding.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I agree with Luke that there’s justice being served after all the evils Serena had done to women. But I felt a bit of sympathy for her, we watched the 2 women connect over motherhood during this episode.</p><p>June’s face expresses that conflict.<a href=#>#HandmaidsTale</a> <a href=#>#TheHandmaidsTale</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8TfKDD54Oo</a></p>— Tanya (@ScriptedTanya) <a href=#>October 19, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does Luke turn in Serena on 'The Handmaid's Tale'?</h2><p>At the end of the Oct. 19 episode, Luke arrives at the hospital and reunites with June. He's triumphant as he explains that he called immigration authorities. And Serena, who doesn't have asylum, since she didn't accept it from Tuello, doesn't have the right to a lawyer to get her out of this. She's handcuffed and informed that her baby is in child protective services.</p><p>Even though June clearly looks conflicted about this, Luke says he is satisfied in showing Serena "what it feels like" to have her child taken away. Now, however, June doesn't seem so sure that's what she wants for Serena anymore. Luke clearly did this as his only play in taking down Serena, who came this close to killing his wife.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>June repenting for her sins and forgiving Serena for hers but Luke still in revenge mode…they are never on the same page and do not communicate effectively. That marriage can’t last. <a href=#>#thehandmaidstale</a></p>— ✨ ✨ (@sparklefuzzy) <a href=#>October 19, 2022</a></figure><p>What this means for Serena is still unclear. Luke, on the other hand, seems to believe he redeemed himself in doing something to help his wife for once. But as we can see at the end of the episode, with Serena screaming and Luke and June looking on, it's not that simple.</p><p>Watch new episodes of The Handmaid's Tale on Wednesdays on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlnKq4pnnTrqmnZZmjerSx0Z6lmmWknbJutMCnm6aZmZnAbsDApZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-luke-turn-in-serena-the-handmaids-tale.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./i-ran-and-i-ran-until-i-could-not-run-out-of-the-reach-of-power-obasanjo-makes-revelation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./i-ran-and-i-ran-until-i-could-not-run-out-of-the-reach-of-power-obasanjo-makes-revelation.html>&amp;quot;I Ran And I Ran Until I Could Not Run Out Of The Reach Of Power&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./october9-html.html>October 9 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./october9-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
