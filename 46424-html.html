Every time you cross the highway, every time you drink Alomo and Paraga, every time you get behind the steering wheels with drugs in your system, it is like putting a loaded gun to one’s head and wondering if it can kill or not.</p><p>It is a huge risk to take and we should stop taking that risk,” said Fashola, who was represented by his deputy, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire.</p><p>Fashola urged commuter vehicle drivers to desist from taking alcohol, drugs or other related substance before going behind the wheel, stressing that evidence abounded that road traffic accidents were influenced and precipitated by substance abuse which impair driver’s ability to manage and manipulate a vehicle well.</p><p>He noted that the Motor Park Health and Safety Awareness Campaign Programme was an initiative of his administration to raise awareness about responsible consumption of alcohol and initiate change in attitude among motor park drivers.</p><p>“The aim of the initiative is to reduce road traffic accidents, thereby ensuring the safety of drivers, passengers and other road users.</p><p>The campaign is also aimed at increasing awareness about mental health and what can be done not only to prevent it but also to cure it.</p><p>It is part of the composite health care plan for the sustainability of our people as well as improving their life expectancy rate,” he explained.</p><p>Commissioner for Transportation, Mr. Kayode Opeifa, urged drivers to dislodge drug and alcohol hawkers from their parks and also cautioned against substance and alcohol abuse, adding that abuse of these controlled drugs was responsible for the high rate of road traffic accidents.</p><p>He noted that the Drivers’ Institutes located in Epe, Ikorodu, Oshodi, Ikeja and Lagos Island were built to train motorists both private and public, about techniques, driving methods and driving habits.</p><p>Opeifa added that the state government would from 1 October, 2013 begin the enforcement of accreditation of all professional and commuter vehicle drivers, stressing that any commuter vehicle driver that does not have certification of the Drivers’ Institute would not be allowed to operate in the state.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXeAkW1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f46424-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./415224-martha-koome-unhappy-4-court-appeal-judges-left-out-reasons-unknown-judiciary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./415224-martha-koome-unhappy-4-court-appeal-judges-left-out-reasons-unknown-judiciary-html.html>Martha Koome Unhappy with Uhurus Decision to Leave Out 6 Judges in Recent Appointments: Bitter</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jeffy-gaming-html.html>Damon LeFever - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jeffy-gaming-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
