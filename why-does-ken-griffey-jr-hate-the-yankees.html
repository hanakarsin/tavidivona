He made a splash as a rookie and continued to be a heck of a competitive player, even in his later years. He was also a phenomenal ambassador for the sport with a squeaky clean image and great personality to boot.</p><p>But there's one thing many people may not know about the star player: he hates the Yankees. But why?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How old is Ken Griffey Jr.?</h2><p>For someone who made his major league debut in 1989, KGJ is fairly young — he's only 50 years old! He's also been fairly active on social media and had somewhat of a resurgence with younger baseball fans when he was featured on the cover of the 2017 version of The Show video game, and then, more recently, with the MLB documentary, Junior.</p><p>You can watch the film on the MLB network, and it contains some eye-opening facts about Ken's life that fans probably weren't cognizant of before. While most folks know Ken had a close relationship with his father, baseball player Ken Griffey Sr., the documentary highlights just how close they were and how much of an influence George Sr. had on his all-star son's life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Griffey Sr. could be the reason why Ken Jr. hates the Yankees.</h2><p>It all started when Ken was younger and hanging out in the clubhouse with his father and he was told to be quiet after making some noise. It's not something that particularly sat well with Ken, because other players' kids were in the clubhouse, too, and while they were being as loud as he was, none of them were instructed to keep it down.</p><p>Griffey Sr. believes the entire situation could be traced back to Griffey Sr. being a part of the 1976 Cincinnati Reds team that swept the Yankees in the World Series. But that wasn't the only incident that began to engender Ken's hatred for the Yankees. Another semi-encounter with George Steinbrenner didn't help matters either.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wow, Ken Griffey Jr. had a really damn good reason to never play for the Yankees.</p><p>"Look at third base." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2v7DoBYyYC</a></p>— Roger Cormier (@yayroger) <a href=#>June 22, 2020</a></figure><p>"Another instance was I came up to visit my dad and it’s just me and him. And a security guard came up and says, ‘Hey, George [Steinbrenner] doesn’t want anybody in the dugout.’ My dad’s like, ‘What? He’s my son,'" Griffey Jr. said in the documentary.</p><p>But before Ken Sr. instructed his son to go into the clubhouse, he told him to look at third base.</p><p>There was the son of Graig Nettles, taking ground balls. The incident still seems to bother Ken until this very day, "And at that time my dad was 38 years old, he was like, ‘I ain’t fighting this no more. I got someone a little younger and a little better.'"</p><p>It wasn't long before Ken was the Mariners' first overall draft pick for the 1989 MLB draft. He'd go on to become one of the biggest names the sport has ever seen.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is why Ken Griffey Jr is my favorite baseball player of all time. Not the swing. Not the swag. Not the unbelievable talent. Just the fact that he hates the Yankees & all their lame bullshit as much as I do.

Ken Jr. responded savagely, "No, if the Yankees were the last team...if they were the only team that gave me a contract...I'd retire."</p><p>He also has a history of playing exceptionally well against the Yanks, too.</p><p>Ken Jr. obliterated the Yankees in the 1995 American League Division series, hitting five home runs, nailing seven RBIs, and clocking in an OPS of 1,488 in five games. Savage.</p><p>In 1999, Ken Sr. tried to get his son to bury the hatchet between the Yankees in the hopes of potentially striking a deal with the lucrative franchise.</p><p>Ken Jr. wasn't interested.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In honor of Father's Day, here's a hilarious story about Ken Griffey Sr. "grounding" Ken Griffey Jr. after a game.</p><p>Catch this and more when <a href=#>#Junior</a> premieres on <a href=#>@MLBNetwork</a> at 8pm ET/5pm PT <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bpUNNLvyIs</a></p>— Cut4 (@Cut4) <a href=#>June 21, 2020</a></figure><p>In fact, when he returned to Seattle in 2008 during the twilight of his baseball career, KGJ was asked what his favorite memory of Yankee stadium was.</p><p>Ken Jr. replied, "It's leaving Yankee stadium."</p><p>It looks like potent hatred is a trademark of many sports legends, just ask <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlm5q7brPRop2fnalit7N5x5qrnmWknbJuxcCnop6dow%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-ken-griffey-jr-hate-the-yankees.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./grandpa-wheel-of-fortune.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./grandpa-wheel-of-fortune.html>Adorable Grandpa Misses Out On Huge 'Wheel Of Fortune' Payday</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-emilia-clarke-in-house-of-the-dragon.html>Is Emilia Clarke in 'House of the Dragon'?
