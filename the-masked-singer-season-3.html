Find Out When It'll Return</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Shannon Raphael</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated Dec. 19 2019, 11:31 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The Masked Singer is unlike any other reality competition because it's both a singing show and a mystery, as the internet tries to guess each week who the singers really are.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Season 2</a> of the hit competition ended on Dec. 18, and viewers finally learned the identities of The Flamingo, The Rottweiler, and The Fox. Now that a winner has been crowned, the next burning question we have is about when the show will come back.</p><p>We'll admit it, we want a new cast, with even more over-the-top costumes than ever before, and we want to speculate as to which celebs are underneath said costumes. When is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Masked Singer Season 3 </a>premiere? Read on to find out the (approaching) date of the premiere episode, and the costumes that will be making their debut on the new season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When does The Masked Singer come back? It's sooner than you'd think.</h2><p>Those who were expecting a long hiatus from The Masked Singer will be relieved to know that Season 3 of the series is set to premiere after the Super Bowl on Feb. 2. This is a highly coveted time slot that usually leads to a huge surge in ratings, so we can expect that Season 3 will be the biggest one yet for The Masked Singer. &nbsp;</p><p>After the episode following the championship football game, the show will return to its regular time slot of Wednesday nights at 8 p.m.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news keeps on coming, as some of the costumes for Season 3 were also teased during the Dec. 18 finale for the second season.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What costumes will be on The Masked Singer Season 3?</h2><p>When the Season 3 promo was released, host Nick Cannon promised that it would include "the biggest celebrities yet." If that didn't get viewers excited for the Super Bowl premiere, then perhaps the three costumes revealed will.</p><p>Nick took time away from his Eminem feud to deliver the costumes all on his own.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>First, Nick dropped off an ultra feminine mouse costume to a mansion in Beverly Hills. The person receiving the costume was obviously concealed, but we did see her legs â€” and she was wearing pink pants, and Ugg boots. She also had a chihuahua wearing a skirt that was standing right next to her.&nbsp;</p><p>If we had to guess, it looks like The Mouse could be someone along the lines of Paris Hilton (let's not forget her interesting singing career), since she was iconically known for carrying around a chihuahua in her purse, and for wearing velour tracksuits.</p><p>Because that's the obvious answer, The Mouse could also be Lisa Vanderpump, who is formerly from RHOBH. She's well-known for her obsession with the color pink. Plus, The Mouse is wearing a flower crown, and Lisa was often filmed picking out flowers for her restaurants or her home, Villa Rosa (which translates to Pink House).</p><p>It could also be someone from 90210, as we know Tori Spelling has done the show before and the Beverly Hills sign was shown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>Nick next delivered The Robot costume to a cowboy on a ranch. The man who received the costume was wearing cowboy boots (with spurs!), a hat, a flannel shirt, and a Texas Longhorn belt buckle. While nobody specific comes to mind, we'd have to assume that this contestant is a country singer or even someone who was once on the Dallas Cowboys.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>After that, the next delivery&nbsp;went to a dressing room. Nick dropped off The Banana, and viewers were given the least insight into the potential celeb behind the costume.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Mrs. Monster (which is a play on T-Pain's winning costume from Season 1) was dropped off at another mansion. The woman who was getting the costume was wearing a cheetah print robe, and she was sipping a drink in a lounge chair overlooking the ocean.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>"You've got to be kidding me," Nick said when he saw who he was delivering Mrs. Monster too. We can only assume that she might be the biggest celebrity who will be on the show, and we have no idea where to begin to even guess as to who she is.&nbsp;</p><p>The Masked Singer Season 3 premieres right after the Super Bowl on Feb. 2.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecyaqqSdlGLAqrrGnqlmq5WWwLC6jGw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-3.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-presidency-dont-set-nigeria-on-fire-gani-adams-warns-baba-ahmed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-presidency-dont-set-nigeria-on-fire-gani-adams-warns-baba-ahmed.html>2023 Presidency: Don't Set Nigeria On Fire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./270843-wabunge-wanusurika-kifo-baada-ya-power-bank-kulipuka-bungeni-html.html>Wabunge wanusurika kifo baada ya 'Power Bank' kulipuka bungeni</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./270843-wabunge-wanusurika-kifo-baada-ya-power-bank-kulipuka-bungeni-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
