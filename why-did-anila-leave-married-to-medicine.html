Ahead of the season, two of the show’s stars,<a href=#> Dr. Contessa Metcalfe</a> and <a href=#>Anila Sajja</a>, announced they were leaving the show after several years.</p><p>Dr. Contessa, who joined the series in Season 5, stated she had “decided to quit” the show the year before and made due on her promise when her final season, Season 9, wrapped. Anila’s exit, however, has been a little more cavalier.</p><p>So, why did Anila leave Married to Medicine after only two seasons? Keep scrolling to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Anila Sajja leave ‘Married to Medicine?’</h2><p>Anila became a main cast member of Married to Medicine in Season 8. While she doesn’t work in the medical field, Anila is literally married to medicine, as her <a href=#>husband, Dr. Kiren Sajja</a>, is a successful doctor and oculofacial plastic surgeon.</p><p>During her time on M2M, Anila had plenty to share, including her proud Indian-American heritage and her fashion and beauty social media influencer career. However, much of Anila’s journey was overshadowed by drama, including an ongoing feud with her co-star <a href=#>Toya Bush-Harris</a>.</p><p>In Season 9 of Married to Medicine, Toya and Anila became at odds when other women in their neighborhood accused Toya of cheating on her husband, <a href=#>Dr. Eugene Harris</a>, with several men. Anila denied spreading the rumor, though the fight between her and Toya would continue to haunt her. When Anila’s Atlanta home was broken into a few episodes later, Toya, <a href=#>Dr. Heavenly Kimes</a>, and several other ladies accused Anila of staging the burglary, which she vehemently denies.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Following a tumultuous season, Anila confirmed leaving Married to Medicine after just two years. In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LoveBScott</a>, Anila didn’t share if her previous issues with her castmates affected her departure. However, she cryptically said there were multiple “sides” to why she exited the series and planned to show her life more on a different platform.</p><p>“There are three sides to a story: somewhere between their story and mine is the TRUTH,” Anila began her statement. “The truth is- only half of the rumors are true. I won’t be on the upcoming season of Married to Medicine, but I won’t be gone for long…I have been working on some projects that will give me the FULL opportunity to continue to share my life journey, family, and my Indian culture.”</p><p>“My story continues whether it is filmed or not [insert side eye emoji],” she added. “Thank you to my loyal fans for the support. I have A LOT to share with you all VERY soon.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Anila ended her statement by thanking Married to Medicine’s producers for the “amazing opportunity” to grow her fanbase through the show. She also encouraged her fans to “stay tuned” for future endeavors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Anila from ‘Married to Medicine’ doing now?</h2><p>As Anila shared when she confirmed her Married to Medicine departure, she continues living outside Bravo’s cameras. Since leaving the show, Anila has remained active on social media, namely Instagram and TikTok, under her handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@anilasajja</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ANILA SAJJA | Atlanta Blogger (@anilasajja)</a></p></figure><p>She shares updates of her life in Atlanta, Ga. on her platform with Dr. Kiren and their children, Aryana and Avir. When she’s not in wifey, mom, or fashion blogger mode, Anila puts her boss hat on as a partner of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Label Tucker</a>, a hair weave and lash extension company based in Georgia.</p><p>And, in case M2M fans were wondering, Anila <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed in October 2023</a> that she and Toya are doing just fine. Looks like her being off-camera helped their relationship. Go figure!</p><p>Catch new episodes of Married to Medicine on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZnp65onnLnpivnV2irrO%2ByJ6bZqyfYrqmsMicoKed</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-anila-leave-married-to-medicine.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nigerians-cannot-have-this-type-of-evil-come-up-again-in-2023-wike-predicts-apc-crash-before-2023-elections.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nigerians-cannot-have-this-type-of-evil-come-up-again-in-2023-wike-predicts-apc-crash-before-2023-elections.html>&amp;quot;Nigerians Cannot Have This Type Of Evil Come Up Again In 2023&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tahir-mamman.html>Read All The Latest News About Tahir Mamman On Naija News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tahir-mamman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
