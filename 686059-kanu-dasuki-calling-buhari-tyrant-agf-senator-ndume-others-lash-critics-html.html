People don’t know that sometimes some suspects are jailed in their own interest Mr. President is not a dictator</i>,” he said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: President Buhari's Media Chat And The Words Of A Tyrant, By Femi Fani-Kayode</p><p>Datti, a close associate of Buhari&nbsp;said the president has not violated any law through the non-release of Dasuki and Kanu.</p><p>Kanu, who is facing a six-count charge including treason, has been in detention since October 14, 2015, when he was arrested by operatives of the Department of State Service. Though he has been granted bail by the court, the federal government has refused to obey the court order.</p><p>On the other hand, Dasuki, who is facing multiple charges before three different courts, was re-arrested last week at the gate of Kuje Prison, Abuja, shortly after he honoured all his bail conditions.</p><p>Buhari had during his first presidential media chat given reasons why both Dasuki and Kanu could not be released from detention.</p><p>Some senior Nigerian lawyers had disagreed with President Buhari. Some of those who had faulted the president were Mahmud Magaji, constitutional lawyer, Festus Ogwuche and others.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mCj25wZqORo8JusMCsrKShXZiurbjIp55mmqWdrrO1jK2wq5meqXqis8Vmqp6mkam8s3nNnaymnV2kwamx0axkpZmjnXqkvsitoJyrXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f686059-kanu-dasuki-calling-buhari-tyrant-agf-senator-ndume-others-lash-critics-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./repentant-boko-haram-insurgents-will-be-reintegrated-back-to-society-fg-insists.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./repentant-boko-haram-insurgents-will-be-reintegrated-back-to-society-fg-insists.html>Repentant Boko Haram Insurgents Will Be Reintegrated Back To Society</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./snow-on-tha-bluff-meaning.html>Here's Why There's a Huge Debate About J.
