Some think that means the two of them are in a relationship, although there's been no confirmation that that's the case. For now, it's just a rumor, although it's one that has many fans wondering who Courtney dated in the past, and how she rose to fame.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Courtney Stodden got famous at a young age.</h2><p>Although she's only 25, Courtney has already been in the public eye for more than a decade. In the past 10 years, she's appeared in a number of reality shows, and she's also worked as a singer and songwriter. All of that has helped her become famous, but the thing she's most notorious for is her relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Hutchison</a>, which has lasted almost as long as she's been in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How did Courtney and Doug wind up together?</h2><p>When she was just 16, Courtney signed up for acting classes that Doug was teaching. Courtney, who has said that she matured at a young age, did not let Doug know how old she was. As a result, he claims that he had no idea she was 16, and the two began to flirt with one another online. When Doug, who was 50 at the time, found out how old she was, he went to Courtney's parents and told them he would break it off if they wanted him to.&nbsp;</p><p>Courtney's parents allowed her to make the final decision, and the two were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ultimately married in 2011</a> when she was still 16. Their marriage drew criticism immediately, and Doug was accused of pedophilia. His agent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped him</a> following the marriage, and he also claimed to have received death threats. Two years after their marriage, they announced their divorce, suggesting that the age gap between them had been a major contributing factor.&nbsp;</p><p>Just a year after that news, the couple announced that they had reconciled, and they renewed their wedding vows in 2015. A year later, they announced that Courtney was pregnant with their first child, but three months into the pregnancy, she said she suffered a miscarriage, although Doug <a href=#>claims she was lying</a>. In 2017, news broke that they had once again separated, and Courtney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially filed</a> for divorce in 2018.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>It’s March 3rd, 2020 - today I am officially divorced from actor Doug Hutchison. It’s an emotional day for me. God only knows how he’s feeling, but I can tell you that it’s for the better. I look back at this picture and feel absolutely taken advantage of. I’ve been scared to even speak up about feeling groomed or being verbally abused during the almost 10 year marriage because I was a child and he was 50 when we married but I’m a woman now and it’s time for me to put my big girl pants on and speak on this matter. I’ve felt completely trapped, manipulated and at times abandoned by adults // growing up in such an environment — it became a lonely and dark place. Stay tuned for my book. And to Doug... I’ll always love you; yet I’ll always be angry. You’ve left me — a child woman, feeling belittled and confused. These things I shall overcome. I wish you well. But please don’t ever do this to another minor again. It’s not right... even if the parent signs off. Wait a respectable amount of time before marrying. Children aren’t on your level. I’ll always love you regardless. Be better. As shall I.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Courtney Stodden</a> (@courtneyastodden) on Mar 3, 2020 at 12:11pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Courtney Stodden dating Brian Austin Green now?</h2><p>Doug and Courtney didn't finalize their divorce until 2020, and her dating life has been relatively low-key other than her relationship with Doug. Now, new rumors have begun to circulate that Courtney is dating Brian Austin Green. The news comes just weeks after Brian announced that he and Megan Fox were officially separating. Now, he's been spotted having lunch with Courtney.&nbsp;</p><p>A witness said that the two did not look like a couple. "They picked up food together," the source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "Brian had already paid for food. They were not acting at all like they are together."&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it was a friendly lunch or the beginning of something more is impossible to say, but both Brian and Courtney are coming off of other long-running relationships, and may be looking for a rebound.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJynpafBr7HYZqqtp5SZsq95w5qroqaX</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-courtney-stodden-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left></div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aubrey-dollar-filthy-rich.html>Who Is Aubrey Dollar?
