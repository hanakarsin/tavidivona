Everyone wants their House name on the Iron Throne, or at least very close to it. Game of Thrones followed the Lannisters‚Äô and <a href=#>Daenerys's (Emilia Clarke)</a> efforts at a grab for the throne, while <a href=#>House of the Dragon</a> gives us a glimpse into the cracks in the Targaryen reign.</p><p>But one thing that can spoil those plans of marriage and heirs is the different characters‚Äô sexual orientations. While we love seeing LGBTQ representation on screen, these characters end up foiling the plans of many families vying for power, further proving why arranged and political marriages are useless. At the same time, the society does seem relatively accepting of LGBTQ characters, as long as they can spurn heirs. So who are the LGBTQ characters in House of the Dragon?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Laenor Velaryon is the only confirmed LGBTQ character in ‚ÄòHouse of the Dragon.‚Äô</h2><p>While sexuality is fluid in the world of Game of Thrones (and in reality), there‚Äôs only one confirmed LGBTQ character in House of the Dragon. We don‚Äôt know him too well yet, but <a href=#>Laenor Velaryon (Matthew Carver)</a>, the only son of <a href=#>Lord Corlys Velaryon, aka the Sea Snake (Steve Toussaint),</a> and Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best), is a gay character in Fire & Blood.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WHAT IF LAENA WAS LOOKING AT RHAE WHEN SHE WAS DOING HER WEDDING DANCE W LAENOR WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT JOFFREY ü§© <a href=#>https://t.co/TlkvVg0r9G</a></p>‚Äî Veronica (commission open) (@thewweskywalker) <a href=#>August 28, 2022</a></figure><p>However, his sexuality plays a major role in the extinction of the Velaryon bloodline. Basically, in the books, Laenor and <a href=#>Rhaenyra Targaryen (Milly Alcock)</a>, are forced to marry for political reasons. This is to strengthen the alliance between the Targaryen and Velaryon houses, as well as to keep the bloodline on the Iron Throne as pure as possible, as the two of them are cousins.</p><p>It‚Äôs relatively well-known by Laenor‚Äôs parents, as well as his relatives, such as Rhaenyra, that his sights are not typically set on women. But because Rhaenyra has romantic interests of her own, they forge a deal to marry but do their own thing when it comes to the bedroom. In the books, Laenor has relations with Ser Joffrey Lonmouth and Ser Qarl Correy, who we may meet in House of the Dragon.</p><p>However, because of this arrangement, there is later dispute over who has the right to the Iron Throne. It is widely believed that Rhaenyra‚Äôs future children are bastards, born to Ser Harwin Strong in infidelity, and not to Laenor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We may meet a few more LGBTQ character in 'House of the Dragon,' as well.</h2><p>While Laenor is a confirmed gay character from Ice and Fire canon, sexuality is pretty fluid in the world. One thing that‚Äôs fun about author George R.R. Martin‚Äôs world-building is that he makes it seem real by basing the story in rumors. By creating potential gossip amongst the characters and using those characters to convey what‚Äôs happening in the world, it really feels like these events actually happened.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>rhaenyra and alicent are giving homoerotic friendship <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/49y7rpmzQL</a></p>‚Äî _ (@sighclexa) <a href=#>August 22, 2022</a></figure><p>Not only does this mean that there could be LGBTQ characters hiding in the woodwork, but it also gives the creators more freedom to play with the characters‚Äô sexualities. So for those fans who are wondering if <a href=#>Rhaenyra and Alicent Hightower (Emily Carey)</a> have some romantic energy, they‚Äôre not necessarily wrong.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, Milly and Emily confirmed that there is subtext beneath the girls‚Äô close friendship exhibited in the first episode. Emily explained that Rhaenyra and Alicent are ‚Äúin love a little bit,‚Äù although Milly joked, ‚ÄúI'm just actually in love with Emily and so I think that's it.‚Äù</p><p>Emma D‚ÄôArcy, who plays the older version of Rhaenyra, explained, "I think there's erotic energy in most intense teenage relationships, because it's a period of trying to work out what one is and what one wants.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>This feeds into a major theme of the series when it comes to women having (or not having) a seat at the table. ‚ÄúThese women aren't given the privilege to know what choices they have because of the world that they live in," Milly refers to a potential romantic relationship between Rhaenyra and Alicent. ‚ÄúThat's the theme that runs through this entire story, and Alicent and Rhaenyra's relationship is a prime example of it."</p><p>Plus, in the books, it‚Äôs rumored that Rhaenyra and Laena Velaryon have a closer relationship than sisters. With Laenor already being gay, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if Rhaenyra and Laenor‚Äôs sister wanted to explore a similar relationship. In addition to them, there are a couple other LGBTQ characters we may meet.</p><p>Jeyne Arryn, also called the Maiden of the Vale and the Lady of Eyrie, sides with the blacks, allies of Rhaenyra who believe she and her family have a right to the throne, when Rhaenyra‚Äôs eldest son Jacaerys approaches her with an alliance. However, it‚Äôs widely believed that Jessamyn Redfort is a ‚Äúdear companion‚Äù to Jeyne.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>jeyne arryn sabitha frey.. and black aly absolutely likes women also so there u go</p>‚Äî niamh (@aemmarryn) <a href=#>August 23, 2022</a></figure><p>Another LGBTQ character we could meet is Alysanne Blackwood, also known as Black Aly. Like <a href=#>House Arryn</a>, House Blackwood was declared for the blacks when Black Aly was just 16-years-old. While on campaign, she shared a tent with Lady Sabitha Frey, who Black Aly was rumored to be ‚Äúvery fond of.‚Äù She eventually married Lord Cregan Stark of Winterfell, who shortly served as Hand to the King Aegon III Targaryen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby2v8Rmpp9lpJ2ybrDRmp6opl2htKPA0GaaoZmilrC1sdGs</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-lgbtq-characters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./everyone-else-work-at-home-employee-office-by-himself.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./everyone-else-work-at-home-employee-office-by-himself.html>&amp;quot;I'm Wasting Company Resources&amp;quot; Employee Forced to Work in Empty Office, Everyone Else is Remote</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1427782-rapper-key-glocks-biography-age-height-real-net-worth-html.html>Rapper Key Glocks biography: age, height, real name, net worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1427782-rapper-key-glocks-biography-age-height-real-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
