Being a registered nurse, my first instinct was of course to stop, assess, and be there to help. She had regained orientation, but did say she was on blood thinners and felt dizzy." &nbsp;"So I stayed with her, along with her daughter and the Walmart personnel, until the ambulance came and tried to encourage her to stay seated. The Walmart staff was amazing. They kept in contact with dispatch as we waited on the bus to arrive.""Then there was Jason. I don't know his last name, but this man, no questions asked got down on the floor with this woman and supported her back so she could lean against him. He literally got down on the floor to serve her, not because he was asked to do it, he wasn't, but because he wanted to." &nbsp;"The media lately shows our country divided, filled with hate and racial tension, but this right here was one human being loving and serving another without condition of race or obligation. While we waited, another man stopped, knelt down and prayed over this woman. What I experienced today was love, kindness, and serving." &nbsp;"We are human beings, each and every one of us regardless of how much pigmentation our skin has or doesn't have. I couldn't help but share because the media doesn't seem to report this... the unity and the positive that occurs. This right here is real life, this is what it's all about, not hate."&nbsp;<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WDBJ7</a> were able to contact manager Jason Lewis, who said that he sat down to support the woman after she lost her balance while trying to get up. Jason says he had no idea Brittany took the picture, and was in a meeting when it started going viral. His wife texted him when the meeting was over and told him to check Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's how my parents do it. I just wanted to live a good life and that's just one of the results of it -- being able to render help when it's actually needed," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The post has also received more than 22,000 comments. With one comment reading:</p>"Thank you for posting, we need to spread good will. God knows the news doesn't. Thank you young man for caring for others. You are inspiring. And Thank you to whoever your role model was, they did a great job."&nbsp;<p>While another added:</p>"Doesn't matter what you look like or color, there's good in just about everyone, helping each other is what this is all about. If I see someone that needs help, I will do it."<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYSOa2xoaXGfuIV%2BjrCYpaWRp8Fuscypo6ixlZp6uLvMmqVmm5%2BhuaK80p6qZp6RmLKju86k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-employee-woman-collapses-facebook.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iyabo-ojo-fathia-williams-end-two-years-rift-appreciate-mc-oluomo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iyabo-ojo-fathia-williams-end-two-years-rift-appreciate-mc-oluomo.html>Iyabo Ojo, Fathia Williams End Two Years Rift, Appreciate MC Oluomo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./saucyrell-html.html>804.saucy - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./saucyrell-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
