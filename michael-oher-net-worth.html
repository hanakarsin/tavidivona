In November 2009, the hit film, The Blind Side, starring <a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a>, was released in theaters nationwide. The movie chronicled the story of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who was taken in by an affluent white family. Thanks to their guidance and support, Michael became a notable offensive tackle in high school and college, and eventually earned a career in the NFL player.</p><p>Although Michael has been vocal about inaccuracies in the film, his journey to success is one that’s very true.

Tannehill, and previously owned by former CEO of the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, Dr. Kevin Churchwell.</p><p>Michael resides in the Brentwood home with his wife, Tiffany Roy, and their four children, daughters Kierstin and Nai, and sons Kobi and MJ.

"Michael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact, provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Interestingly, the 14-page petition shares that a few months after Michael turned 18 in 2004, the couple tricked him into signing a conservatorship agreement that legally allowed them to make business deals using his name. Sadly, the couple never adopted him, as depicted in the film.</p><p>Also, the petition states that the Tuohy’s used their titles as conservators to strike a deal that helped them obtain millions from the film which grossed more than $300 million. Michael never saw a penny from the royalties while the Touhys, including their two children, reaped the benefits.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Oher (@michaeloher)</a></p></figure><p>On the flip side, Sean shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Memphian</a> that he was shocked to learn about Michael’s petition.</p><p>"We’re devastated," Sean told the outlet. "It’s upsetting to think we would make money off any of our children. But we’re going to love Michael at 37 just like we loved him at 16."</p><p>Sean also shared that he found out about the case after a friend sent him the ESPN article.</p><p>"We were never offered money; we never asked for money," Sean said. He also said that “Michael Lewis, the author of the book 'The Blind Side,' gave the family, including Michael, half of his share.” Tuohy told the newspaper that it was around $14,000 each.</p><p>In the Touhy’s 2010 book, In a Heartbeat: Sharing the Power of Cheerful Giving, they said, “We divided it five ways,” in regards to the money earned from the film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@moc</a></figure><p>Michael’s attorney, J. Gerard Stranch IV, told ESPN that Michael wasn't able to investigate the deal due to the film’s success being linear with his NFL career. He was only able to do so after retirement.</p><p>The goal of Michael’s petition is to end the Tuohy’s conservatorship and obtain a full accounting of the money the Tuohys earned using his name. Michael wants the couple to pay him his fair share of profits along with unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Michael also wants an injunction that bars the Touhys from using his name and likeness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2anmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-oher-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./edo-2020-tambuwal-warns-inec-buhari-ahead-govship-election.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./edo-2020-tambuwal-warns-inec-buhari-ahead-govship-election.html>Tambuwal Warns INEC, Buhari Ahead Gov'ship Election</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./charice-pempengco-html.html>Jake Zyrus - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./charice-pempengco-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
