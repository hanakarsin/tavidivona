We want to assure people that swearing-in (of Tinubu) is a ceremony that does not tie the hands of the court,” Uche said.</p><p>He added that an election can be overturned by the court regardless of whether or not a previously declared winner has been sworn in.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has said he deliberately closed the country’s land borders against smugglers in order to encourage the local production of rice and other food items.</p><p>The Nigerian leader stated this on Tuesday at the official commissioning of the new Nigeria Customs Service Corporate Headquarters in the Maitama area of Abuja.</p><p>President Buhari stated that although the move was initially criticized by Nigerians, the closure of the land borders was eventually appreciated by the citizens.</p><p>Buhari said he nominated Hameed Ali as Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) because of his experience and competence.</p><p>The president said he chose Ali to lead the Customs following his achievements during the tenure of the former military head of state, the late Sani Abacha.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari has approved several appointments, redeployment, and re-organization of personnel within agencies in the Ministry of Aviation.</p><p>The development which comes just six days before Buhari hands over power to a new administration on May 29, is designed to reposition the agencies to perform their statutory duties as enshrined in the Acts which set them up.</p><p>According to a statement in Abuja on Tuesday on behalf of the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika by the Head of Press & Public Affairs of the Ministry of Aviation, Odutayo Oluseyi, the President approved the appointment of Kabir Yusuf Mohammed as the new Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).</p><p>Until his appointment, Mohammed was the Regional General Manager of Central Region Airports, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and Chairman of the Aviation Roadmap Implementation Committee.</p><p>Engr Tayib Odunowo has also been appointed the substantive Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA).</p><p>The statement also confirmed the appointment of some new Directors which according to Sirika is to address the requirements of the Acts for appropriate placements, and Federal character requirements.</p><p>President-elect, Bola Tinubu on Tuesday held a meeting with former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair , revealing that conversations about mutual interest of the two countries were discussed.</p><p>Naija News reports Tinubu hosted Blair at the Defence House in Abuja.</p><p>Speaking about the meeting, Tinubu via his Official Twitter page, said that the former minister had discussed areas of mutual interests and how Nigeria will continue to benefit from the Tony Blair’s institute for good governance.</p><p>Sharing photos from the meeting, the former Lagos governor wrote: “I received former British Prime Minister and founder Tony Blair Institute for Good Governance, Mr Tony Blair, at the Defence House, Abuja, earlier today.</p><p>“We discussed areas of mutual interests and how Nigeria can continue to benefit from the amazing work of the Institute.”</p><p>Also present at the meeting was the Vice President-elect, Senator Kashim Shettima, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday commissioned the newly built Nigeria Customs Service Corporate (NCS) Headquarters in Abuja.</p><p>With Buhari at the commissioning of the project are the Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Mohammed Musa Bello, Comptroller-General of NCS, Col.
