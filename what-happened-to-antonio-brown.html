This time, he began comparing Steelers Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada to Adolf Hitler by posting a photo of Matt with a drawn-on mustache. Antonio appears to have drawn the facial hair to resemble that of Hitler before following up the post with a Tweet saying "Adolf Canada."</p><p>Worse yet, he made the posts on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.</p><p>“Matt Canada is a terrible offensive coordinator. Last week we scored six points in four quarters,” Antonio said in a video ahead of a football game. “I think I should call the plays being that I am an offensive schemer and I am putting the players in the best position to emphasize their skills. Check me out: AB, offensive coordinator.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Antonio Brown was previously arrested for domestic battery.</h2><p>After a tumultuous career in the <a href=#>NFL</a>, <a href=#>Antonio</a> has been in the news but for mainly bad reasons. Multiple reports on Dec. 1, 2022, suggested that a warrant was issued for Brown's arrest, which naturally led many to wonder what happened to him. Looking at the details in the report, though, it seems that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">warrant was issued</a> after an alleged domestic battery incident.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The incident took place at approximately 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 28, 2022, and involved Brown and an unidentified woman in South Tampa, Fla.</p><p>"At some point later on, the argument turned physical, after the suspect threw a shoe at the victim," a police statement said. "The suspect also attempted to evict the victim from the residence and locked her out of the home."</p><p>Brown was wanted on suspicion of battery, and the warrant for his arrest was issued by a court. Few additional details about the incident were available, but it was just the latest story in Brown's spiral out of a career in the NFL. Of course, many are naturally wondering who the woman Brown was arguing with is, but that information has yet to be disclosed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>He didn't face charges for the incident. “The SAO analyzed this new information along with the body worn camera video recorded at the scene, the Child Protective Services investigation, and the denial of a law enforcement’s Temporary Risk Protection Order and determined we could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt a battery took place,” State Attorney’s Office in Tampa said in a statement.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In August 2023, Antonio was issued another warrant for unpaid child support. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, he missed a $15,000 payment to his ex, Wiltrice Jackson.

He abandoned his gear, and Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said that Brown had been cut from the team following the incident.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brown eventually claimed that he was cut from the team because he refused to play with an ankle injury.</p><p>"I know we were losing to the Jets and that was frustrating for all of us. But I could not make football plays on that ankle," Brown later said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement released by his attorney</a>. "Yes, I walked off the field. But there's a major difference between launching from the line and taking hits, compared to jogging off the field with a rush of emotions going through your mind. I am reflecting on my reaction, but there was a trigger."</p><p>"The trigger was someone telling me that I'm not allowed to feel pain," he continued. "I acknowledge my past. But my past does not make me a second-class citizen. My past does not forfeit my right to be heard when I am in pain."</p><p>Brown hasn't played in the NFL since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Antonio Brown doing now?</h2><p>Ever since Brown left the NFL, he has continuously been involved in controversies.
