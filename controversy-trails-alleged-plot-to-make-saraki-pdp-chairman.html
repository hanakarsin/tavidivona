<time>29 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/saraki-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Indications have emerged that there are moves to make the former Senate President and Kwara State ex-governor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bukola Saraki</a>, the National Chairman of the leading opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p><p><strong>Naija News,</strong> however, gathered that there are already controversies trailing the plot and possible decisions by some party chieftains.</p><p>While some think Saraki is the only person now with what it takes to unify the party from all the crisis bit experienced during the 2023 general election, others believe his emergence as the party’s chairman might raise other forms of crisis.</p><p>Recall that following its defeat at the February 25 presidential election, its embattled former national chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, was suspended by his ward executives and subsequently sacked from office.</p><p>The executive members of Igyorov ward, Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, had voted no confidence on Ayu over alleged anti-party activities in March 2023.</p><p>According to Daily Trust, some party chieftains and stakeholders are already making moves to reposition the party by getting an able National Chairman that can rally the support of the aggrieved members and work to renew the main opposition party.</p><p>One of Saraki’s allies, who pleaded anonymity, told the platform, “Please, this is an issue I cannot say anything about. This development, as you very well know, is ongoing with discussion in many quarters within the PDP. Our leader, the former Senate president Bukola Saraki has not said anything. He has not also informed us to say anything so that you can understand my situation.</p><p>“I can tell you that all that have been happening or suggestions that have been taking place are among those that feel he has what it takes to take over the party at this critical period and probably change its fortunes.</p><p>“You know where we are coming from and the situation of the party at present. So, let us watch what will happen in the coming days.”</p><p>However, giving his relation to the issue, the National Coordinator of Saraki Support Group for the 2023 presidential election, Osaro Onaiwu, told Daily Trust that there is “A lot of pressure from the North Central people, adding that they want him to come and rebuild the party.</p><p>“A lot of people in the country and across other zones want him to come and rebuild the party.”</p><p>Onaiwu, however, disclosed that the former Senate President is yet to make up his mind concerning the issue.</p><p>He noted that “As it stands, he is the only one that can bring everyone back to the table; he is a unifying factor, the bridge between the old and the young, South and North.</p><p>“He has done it before during the reconciliation of the party, he went around the country, so he will do it if he accepts the job. People are putting pressure on him to come and do the job.”</p><p>“For me, as his former DG, we are watching how things are unfolding, the party is at the Tribunal, and I learnt some persons are appealing the removal of Dr. Iyorchia Ayu. I will want to see how that goes before I jump into the wagon of those that want him to be chairman of the party.</p><p>“The issue is that I cannot allow his brand to be humiliated; he is a good brand, and he would rebuild the party, but we must allow things to move in the normal way.</p><p>“I will want a united party, a party that is strong as an opposition that can reconcile aggrieved parties. We have factions in states; we need a strong character that can bring everyone back on the table.”</p><p>Meanwhile, another source who is in the know of the plans disclosed that positioning the former senate President for the party’s top job has also pitched some stakeholders against themselves in the party.</p><p>The source who wouldn’t want to be named, however, cautioned that if not handled carefully, the matter can open another frontier of crisis.</p><h2>PDP Reacts</h2><p>Commenting on the issue, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, told the platform that he was not aware of any such move.</p><p>Ologunagba, however, disclosed that the PDP is working within its rules on the chairmanship issue and will apply its constitution adequately and at the right time, adding, “We don’t work based on the expectation of people.”</p><p>He said: “I am not aware of anybody angling to be party chairman. The party is working in line with our constitution, we are a party of rule of law and constitution, and we are applying our constitution accordingly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BvZpynnqm%2FsMLEq6qyZaSnrqq40maYpaSVnLKlec%2Blpq1lpKR6rq3KnmSsmaKWuKp5z52nZpuYlrazucCnZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcontroversy-trails-alleged-plot-to-make-saraki-pdp-chairman.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elvis-presley-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elvis-presley-html.html>Elvis Presley - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./world-wizkids-day-check-out-5-wizkids-major-achievements.html>Check Out 5 Wizkid's Major Achievements</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./world-wizkids-day-check-out-5-wizkids-major-achievements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
