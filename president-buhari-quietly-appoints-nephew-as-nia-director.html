His trip on presidential jet had flagrantly violated Buhari’s ban on interstate travel at the time.</p><p>He was said to have reportedly influenced the arrest of Mrs. Buhari’s security aides, following an altercation that had ensued as a result of his repeated non-compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols.</p><p>A presidency source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>PeoplesGazette</strong></a> that Buhari has become increasingly desperate to shield not just himself but his closest associates from criminal charges.</p><p>Sources said the president recognised the importance of protecting his inner circles even beyond his stay in power..</p><p>“Unlike Goodluck Jonathan who did not protect his officials from being hounded when they left power in 2015, President Buhari is committed to ensuring that his people are in good shape either in or out of government to withstand being held accountable by the next administration,” the presidency source said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49yZqmqlai2pbHNrWSbrZiWv6p50K6gnqycrnqivM%2BooKeso2K7przHnq5mmaNiu6qtjJ2gq52Tqbyzew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpresident-buhari-quietly-appoints-nephew-as-nia-director.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-do-the-photo-swipe-trend-on-tiktok.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-do-the-photo-swipe-trend-on-tiktok.html>TikTok's Photo Swipe Trend Has Creators Ready to Showcase Their Skills</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./four-dead-following-bandit-attack-in-benue-community.html>Four Dead Following Bandit Attack In Benue Community</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./four-dead-following-bandit-attack-in-benue-community.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
