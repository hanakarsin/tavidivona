I was at the intersection on the same side of the street with her, crossing, and as she like gets out of her car, whatever, she's on the same side, same side of the sidewalk, she like locks her door three times," Kingsley says smiling into the camera and walking down the street.</p><p>"But then she sees me and walks back to lock her door like, again, like staring at me like pressing the lock two more times so she's locked her door five times," the TikToker says, holding her cup of coffee.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kingsleymusic href=#>@kingsleymusic</a><p>When life gives your lemons, buy the stand ü´† Oh Portland ‚úãüèª ppl, this was on Mississippi Street, a street that use to be filled with Black folks.

She's wearing a bonnet and a large black T-shirt with a pink graphic design on it.</p><p>Feeling some type of way that the woman was afraid she would attempt to burglarize her vehicle, Kingsley decided to let the aggressive over car-locker know how she felt about the constant key fob button pushing. "So I grab her door handle and I pull and I say it's locked!"</p><p>She begins laughing into the camera. "And I just keep walking. 'Cause you're not gonna make me feel any type of way except for goofy as hell," she says as the video cuts out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kingsleymusic</span></figure><p>Kingsley further explained her outlook on the situation: "When life gives your lemons, buy the stand ü´†."</p><p>She also indicated that she believes the woman's behavior could be attributed to the fact that she was walking around in a particular West Coast city: "Oh Portland ‚úãüèª ppl, this was on Mississippi Street, a street that use to be filled with Black folks."</p><p>She capped off her message with another message for the woman who kept eye-balling her and locking/re-locking her car doors: "What you aren‚Äôt guna do it make me feel less than!" Kingsley remarked.</p><p>Racial discourse has been the cornerstone of political campaigns for the past few years, and were a big talking point headed into the last three presidential races. While many believe that discourses surrounding race are being weaponized to divide Americans to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vote against their best economic interests</a>, this doesn't invalidate the harm caused by racism.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kingsleymusic</span></figure><p>Although the mayor of Portland is Ted Wheeler, a member of the Democratic party, which often touts racial issues as being a key social ill that it wishes to address, and Tina Kotek is the governor of Oregon, who is also a member of the DNC and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has recently announced a Director of Equity and Racial Justice</a>, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Times writes that Portland is still America's "whitest" big city</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Portland.gov</a> has even written about "racist planning" in the city, and how the way the city's been structured has systemically prevented people of color from being able to own homes in specific areas: "This systemic discrimination, which was also practiced nationwide and goes back to the origins of our country, has harmed communities of color by excluding them from homeownership and wealth-building opportunities ..."</p><p>The resource went on to state that it also excludes these communities by "denying them access to educational resources, jobs and healthy neighborhoods; and perpetuating segregation, displacement, and harmful stereotypes through the zoning code, deeds and covenants, lending practices, public housing and urban renewal."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kingsleymusic</span></figure><p>Currently, in the United States, the idea of home ownership is one that has widely affected various citizens as it is now more difficult to purchase a home in American than it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was for prospective buyers during the Great Depression</a>.</p><p>TikTokers who saw Kingsley's post applauded the woman for taking "the opportunity to do the funniest thing" and actually doing it.</p><p>Someone else quipped: "You did such a nice thing for her since she was clearly so scared her locks were broken."</p><p>Another person said that they decided to flip the script and act racist toward white people: "I clutch my purse closer to me around yt people."</p><p>Whereas someone else said that they have found themselves worrying about locking their car after meeting another person's gaze because they're afraid the other person is going to think they're locking it because of them.</p><p>"I'm over here on the opposite end, leaving my car unlocked, cuz I accidentally made eye contact with someone and now am afraid they will be offended if I lock it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqwMRmrqilkaN6s7HPnpitnZShxm64zpyirGWTlr8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhite-woman-repeatedly-locks-car.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1525643-i-a-date-mango-seller-perfect-shape-uses-waist-dance-video-viral-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1525643-i-a-date-mango-seller-perfect-shape-uses-waist-dance-video-viral-html.html>&amp;quot;I Want to Take You Out on a Date&amp;quot;: Mango Seller With Perfect Shape Uses Waist to Dance, Video Goes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./506790-shekaus-absence-new-video-causes-even-concerns-absence-html.html>Shekau's Absence In New Video Is Widely Publicized</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./506790-shekaus-absence-new-video-causes-even-concerns-absence-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
