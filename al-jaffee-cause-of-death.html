Recently, news broke that Al had died at 102 years old.</p><p>Although 102 certainly suggests that Al Jaffee led a long and fulfilling life, many nonetheless wondered about the prolific cartoonist's cause of death. Here's what to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@mad.magazine</span><p>An Al Jaffee cartoon</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was Al Jaffee's cause of death?</h2><p>Fani Thomson, Al's granddaughter, announced his death, and said that his cause of death was multiple organ failure. Al essentially died of old age.</p><p>He was married twice, first to Ruth Ahlquist and then to Joyce Revenson in 1977. Joyce died in 2020, but Al is survived by two children from his first marriage, two step-children, five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Al Jaffee continued to draw for 'Mad' magazine' into his 90s.</h2><p>Al is the longest-serving contributor in the history of Mad magazine, and his legacy at that institution seems unlikely to be matched. He was responsible for some of the magazine's most iconic features, including its fold-ins “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions” and “Al Jaffee’s Mad Inventions.” One of those mad inventions, a razor with an insane number of blades, eventually became a reality.</p><p>The fold-in became well known for both its biting political commentary and its sharp style. The feature, which was meant to be a simpler version of glossy foldouts that were becoming common in major magazines at the time, depicted a full-page image with an accompanying question. When you took out the middle third of a given fold-in, the answer to that question would be revealed, as well as a new drawing built out of pieces of the fuller picture.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@mad.magazine</span><p>Al Jaffee's self-portrait</p></figure><p>The fold-ins often weren't afraid to ask and answer fairly direct, pointed questions about the state of American culture. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, one from 1968 asked, "What is the one thing most school dropouts are sure to become?” and showed a line of young people looking for a job. The answer? "Cannon fodder," a reference to the war in Vietnam that was raging at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>102 years old, and still gone much too soon. RIP to one of my all-time heroes, the great Al Jaffee. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hJ4XhcoCGl</a></p>— Al Yankovic (@alyankovic) <a href=#>April 10, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Al Jaffee was born in Georgia in 1921.</h2><p>Born to Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, Al was born in the U.S. but his mother took Al (born Abraham) and his three brothers back to Lithuania when he was 6, leaving their father behind. In 1933, as Hitler rose to power, Al's father took his children back to the U.S. Their mother stayed behind, and Al never saw her again. He believes that she was likely killed in the Holocaust, alongside most of the town's Jewish residents.</p><p>Al's first piece for Mad magazine appeared in 1955, and although he left the magazine for other ventures, he returned before the end of the decade and became one of the magazine's most prolific voices as it commented on the turbulent decades that followed. Al built a legacy as one of the greatest illustrators of his generation, and that legacy is one that many will remember for decades to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrlutsCfnZ6dXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fal-jaffee-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./candice-boyd-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./candice-boyd-html.html>Candice Boyd - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-ceaser-black-ink-crew.html>What Happened to Ceaser Emanuel From Black Ink Crew?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-to-ceaser-black-ink-crew.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
