She ended up living back with her mom and stepdad, saying, "I think I had out-of-body experiences in Germany. Where I was a child and I was screaming and kicking on the floor, bawling my eyes out. It was like I was looking down on myself, going, 'Why are you behaving this way?'"</p><p>Adding, "I was just a shell of myself."</p><p>Following her move home, Kaitlyn went through "dark times" and decided to seek help from a medical professional. A doctor prescribed her the antidepressant Valium and the reality star explained that she felt "numb" while taking the drug.&nbsp;</p><p>"I didn't feel anything. I got to sleep, I got to not feel my feelings, and that felt great to me," she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Kaitlyn explained that she became addicted to the prescription drug and weighed close to 90 pounds. "That was when somebody had to shake me and say, 'You can't live like this. This is not you,'" she said. "I couldn't live like that anymore." Eventually, the ABC star decided to turn her life around.</p><p>"I was sick of being numb. I wanted to feel feelings again. I wanted to go back to Vancouver and get a job and start over and meet people and get out. So I did," she told listeners. Adding, "I always think if I could go back to my 27-year-old self and talk to her, I would say, 'You can't let anyone be responsible for your own happiness. That is up to you.'"&nbsp;</p><p>The Bachelor Nation star was eventually cast on Chris Soules' season, before becoming the Bachelorette and getting engaged to Shawn Booth. The couple split in 2018, and Kaitlyn is currently dating Bachelorette alum Jason Tartick.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kaitlyn Bristowe addresses plastic surgery rumors.</h2><p>It's no surprise that many contestants on the hit ABC series who move on from the show and market themselves as social media influencers get a few tweaks done to their face. Since starring in Season 11 of The Bachelorette, fans have accused Kaitlyn of getting plastic surgery. So, did she?</p><p>Though she has not confirmed if she's received lip or cheek fillers, which has been speculated, the reality star did respond to the accusations on Snapchat, posting a photo of herself crying. She captioned the pic: "I’m crying. Not because people tell me I’m not beautiful anymore, say I get too much Botox, and ask wtf happened to my face. I’m crying because the world we live in makes me not want to bring beautiful innocent children into it. And that kills me.”</p><p>&nbsp;Overall, whether Kaitlyn has or has not had plastic surgery, it's her business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6qwMuypWaaop7AtbvWnmSwnZmctbV5y6iqrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkaitlyn-bristowe-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./megan-boni-looking-for-a-man-in-finance-song.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./megan-boni-looking-for-a-man-in-finance-song.html>Meet TikTok's &amp;quot;Looking for a Man in Finance&amp;quot; Song Creator Megan Boni</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jynxzi-html.html>Jynxzi - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jynxzi-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
