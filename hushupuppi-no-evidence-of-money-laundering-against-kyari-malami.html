The monies were withdrawn and utilised by the aforementioned account holders and the lady.</p><p>“It is our view that the above response has not linked the suspect, DCP Abba Kyari, to the offence of money laundering as the evidence contained in the case diary is not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin, more so that the aforementioned recipients or receivers exonerated him in their statements as having nothing to do with the monies.”</p><p>Malami further stated that police might have to explore their internal disciplinary measures against Kyari through the Police Service Commission for breaching the code of conduct for law enforcement officers by relating with people of questionable character.</p><p>He further stated that Kyari could be punished for violating the social media policy of the police by responding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s indictment on Facebook; breaching the Police Code of Professional Ethics by accepting complaints and acting on such without recourse to established protocol and detaining a suspect, Vincent Chibuzor, for over a month without a valid court order and regards to his fundamental human rights.</p><p>The DPP while speaking on the new directive of the minister noted it was based on the report submitted by the police, adding that the police failed to probe the gaps identified in their investigation by the ministry.</p><p>Abubakar noted that Malami did not say there was no evidence of money laundering against Kyari.</p><p>The DPP stated, “We said in the absence of the evidence, further investigation is needed and they should go-ahead to try him on the administrative offences they have identified. We said they (police) should establish linkages – the money trail.</p><p>“Instead of them to go and investigate further the gaps we identified, they didn’t. They just wrote back to say ‘check paragraphs so and so’. We are saying no, those paragraphs did not sufficiently establish the things we say you should establish.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BsZqGto53CscHPqaBmpp9isre1w56lnJ1dpLNuuc6nnLJlnJbCr7DEq6Cnn12WtKK1zayrZqOplr%2Bqecyao5qlmWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhushupuppi-no-evidence-of-money-laundering-against-kyari-malami.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./more-confusion-as-ward-chairman-insist-jonathan-joined-apc-in-2019.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./more-confusion-as-ward-chairman-insist-jonathan-joined-apc-in-2019.html>More Confusion As Ward Chairman Insist Jonathan Joined APC In 2019</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brian-wecht-html.html>Brian Wecht - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brian-wecht-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
