<time>26 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=align-left><strong>A picture equals a thousand words. Well, Instagram hit home with this idea and wow! Instagram now rules the social platform as a major marketing, networking, and organic audience-building app for people and brands. Whether you are an amateur photographer or own an online store; social activist or a promoter of that new movie, Instagram is the spot for you. This platform could provide you with the recognition you need. But that becomes possible only when you have a huge list of free Instagram followers, as only those who follow you will get to see your posts regularly. Although good content is what brings you followers and fans, there are other methods to get Instagram followers. This post is for you to get a holistic view of how you get people to follow your Instagram feed.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs5ut7esmramb.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Who is the owner of Instagram now (2018)?</strong></p><h2>A few simple tasks you could perform for more followers</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/45a90464a41d0964.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best DM me a number games for Instagram to play with your friends</span></p></a><h3>1. Design your homepage</h3><p class=align-left>By that, I mean you need to have your bio filled in (if you haven’t already). It is mostly necessary to add proper details about you on your Instagram profile. It has been named “profile” for a reason. Unless you are already popular and a lot of people recognize you and follow your Instagram account, you need to have some basic and interesting information about yourself on your profile. Think of this task as preparing your biodata. Although not an interview or audition, people like to know whom they want to follow. Put up a nice profile image. Use image captions and have a proper username (one that is user-friendly and easy to find).</p><h3>2. Adjust your settings</h3><p class=align-left>Make your profile public. In the settings tab, you will find an option to either keep your Instagram profile private or public. If you are looking for followers, you should keep it to ‘Public’ because that is how your posts will be available to attract their attention. This helps everyone access your profile. Remove tags of unnecessary pictures which interfere with your content.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a32fe3edefacb293.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>130+ best flirty comments for your crush's pics on Instagram</span></p></a><h3>3. Be consistent</h3><p class=align-left>Nobody would prefer to follow a profile that does not have any regularity in its content or its posts. Imagine yourself following a celebrity. You are following him/her because you are interested in their posts and updates. How would you start to feel if you saw their post once in a month? It would soon feel frustrating. That is why you might lose a few important followers who always liked your posts and boosted its popularity. Try to make regular posts; in that way, your followers will stick to you for your activity. Preferably, schedule your posts so that your followers know what to look for and when. Use the story option to provide a pre-update of your upcoming post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/45a90464a41d0964.jpeg><h3>4. Have a theme</h3><p class=align-left>Organized and symmetrical things are preferable over untidy and unpolished stuff. It is the same with this photo-sharing platform. Do not go on to be a jack of all trades; rather, try to opt for one genre or topic that will be the base of your posts. Suppose you are a fitness enthusiast; post about gyms and workout routines etc. Talk about a certain topic and associate your posts with it. It not only helps in the consistency bit but also makes you reach out to a specific audience. Building an organic audience generates more response.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5c11ba57d1a964c6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 very useful websites you didn't know existed in 2020</span></p></a><h3>5. Be descriptive</h3><p class=align-left>Your caption is your area to explain in details, your work or idea backing your image; or say, further your page and its theme. You have probably come across numerous posts which are simple photos with no explanation or idea regarding what the post is actually about. It can become uninteresting and meaningless to be your follower if you have such posts. So try to explain the concept or thought behind your content. It helps people relate to your content and understand your posts.</p><h3>6. Increase visibility</h3><p class=align-left>Link your profile to other social sites. Participate in conversations in different groups or pages. Include more hashtags in the caption, especially, the hashtags that are globally trending on Instagram. Get other pages and influencers to share your content. And most importantly, keep your profile visibility in a “public” mode. Hashtags are a great way to boost your posts on the global page. If you use trending hashtags, your post will come side by side with other posts sharing the same hashtag.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/179ed137de93c0f8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>200+ best comments for a boy's pic on Instagram to compliment him</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a32fe3edefacb293.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Kenyans up in arms over Instagram page with extremely graphic adult content performed by youngsters</strong></p><h3>7. Engage your audience</h3><p class=align-left>Build up a relationship with your audience. Set up a communication via stories, polls, contests, live sessions or simple conversation through comments and feedbacks. You might have a million followers who like your posts and post comments. You should know, the more likes and comments your posts have, the more people will turn up to follow you. Even a celebrity who does not communicate with fans is not much admired. Arrogance can be slightly handled but not always. Engage with the public on the comments or make posts that make it easier for them to communicate with you.</p><p class=align-left>These are the basic methods you need to follow if you are looking for free Instagram followers no survey tricks. These aren’t even tricks. They are simple ways you need to maintain which can help you make your Instagram shine. There are other methods too. There are many other methods of gaining followers on Instagram as well. Some are hassle-free, for example, signing up to a certain website that helps to gain followers in an automated way. And some come up with the work of following and un-following of profiles. Lately, such apps and services have piled up the online market. You can find many people who claim to have been helped by such services.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e168df0b1ccbc095.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to find a specific person on Tinder</span></p></a><h2>How to get followers on Instagram</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7g23agqte5c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since we are done with the simple things, let us get down to an in-depth discussion on how to get more followers on Instagram. Apart from maintaining your profile in the above-mentioned ways, there are additional tricks to get free Instagram followers. You do not have to pay for any of these tricks. After you read this post, you might notice that all I wrote about here is basically common sense and not any rocket science. So, let’s get it started already.</p><ul><li>Usage of hashtags is a great way to boost the audience on your page. They help in the increase of followers by just getting added to your captions. You might have noticed hundreds and thousands of photos which have a whole bunch of hashtags below in the caption area. If you did not know about this before, you might have just wondered why anyone would bother to write useless hashtags and waste their time. Well, surprise surprise! Turns out those were not just a waste of time. Adding hashtags to your posts can actually get your posts in the global scene as popular hashtags group posts, and people following a certain hashtag will be able to see your photos while scrolling down the random public posts. You can add plenty of hashtags but not more than thirty. So, go pick the trendiest tags and get your content recognized.</li><li>If you have accounts on other social media sites, it is a great thing because you can promote your Instagram profile there. Let people know what to expect from your content if they follow you. For instance, if you are a photographer who just started, you can tell them about the kind of projects you are working on and the kind of photos or sneak peeks you will be sharing with them on your Instagram profile.</li><li>The key to gaining followers is not only about hashtags and keeping a sleek profile. Another way to enhance the coming of followers is by liking hundreds of random posts from people who fall in the range of your target audience. According to experiences of Neil Patel, he had tried this strategy and learned that he received not just 1000 free followers on Instagram but 6.1 million followers for every 100 random photos he liked. If he has done it, so can you. It could be a little too irritating to like so many pictures every day, but if you are serious about gaining followers, it might just be what you haven’t tried. Commenting nice and appropriate things on random photos can also help in this case. It is one very natural way to gain more followers.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6981ff94dd8460de.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to view Facebook profile as public</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5c11ba57d1a964c6.jpeg><ul><li>If you are ready to go a step further for new followers, you can try holding little contests on your Instagram account. It is pretty easy if you are up for it. You can post a picture which promotes the contest and mention that liking that post will grant them entries to it. The contest could be of anything you like. Rewarding the winners with little gifts could be an addition to your chances of increased followers.</li><li>It might sound unbelievable to you but research shows that posting photos on Instagram at 2 a.m and<a id=https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/get-instagram-likes_n_6751614 href=# title rel="nofollow noopener"> 5 p.m</a> is the best way to reach out to more people. Founder of Latergramme, Matt Smith, thinks people are more engaged at this point in time. According to the data provided by Latergramme, profitable timing even changes from day to day. On Mondays, the highest engagement period is 7 p.m and 10 p.m, while on Fridays, the timings are 1 a.m and 8 p.m. Seems like one of the answers to “how to get Instagram followers” is punctuality. Timings can also decide the chances of gaining followers.</li><li>Quantity has always been known to get beat by quality. Do not fill up your profile with hundreds of pointless photos of this and that (unless that is what your profile is for). Keep the most relevant and high-quality photos. Most and many people like to follow someone who has valid good posts. You will hardly come across people who indulge in meaningless images.</li><li>Initiating a connection is a great way to get an audience. Try making your questions a little interrogative. For example, ask questions in the captions of your photos. It boosts engagement.</li><li>Sundays should be the best day for Instagram posts. Most people do not post on Sundays and are rather busy taking some time off. Posting on this day might just be able to get your profile more visibility.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/32568b85d8ef0980.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best Instagram bio for boys to use in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You now have more than enough tricks and methods to your query “How to get many followers on Instagram?” You see, it is not so hard to obtain followers, but at the same time, it is not really easy either. Increasing followers on Instagram requires time and patience, and good content ideas. If you are able to move in with the flow, your Instagram account will soon be flooded with, if not thousands, hundreds of followers.</p><p class=align-left>If you are ready to spend some money for free Instagram followers instantly, there is yet another way to do that. Although it might be an easy trick, I cannot guarantee you definite results. There are several apps for your phone on the internet which claim to give you an instant boost of followers on your Instagram page. You will run across a lot of positive reviews stating that the app really works and stays up to its claims. But again, you will also find reviews and articles stating most of such applications are harmful and scams.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d056fe6a6e8bc276.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best money making apps in Kenya for genuine income online</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Either way, I have a list of some of the top-rated Instagram followers generator you could check out.

During its initial days, not many could have probably guessed that Instagram would have engaged millions and millions of active users in a matter of few years and its number of users would keep growing. This social media network reached a user base of more than 800 million per month as of September 2017. That is a pretty huge deal; admit it.</p><p class=align-left>Instagram is helpful for both individual profiles as well as business profiles. If you are a businessperson in this age, you probably already know that building a strong audience on Instagram is almost a "must-do". Why? Because most people use Instagram and actually make a profit through this photo sharing app. Let us explain:</p><h3>1. Magnifying brand visibility</h3><p class=align-left>With the presence of more than 800 million users a month, and over a billion daily photos being shared, you can understand how vast and active Instagram user strength is. You will benefit well by being a part of the exposure. People tend to like and want what they see looks and does well. When you post nice content, your followers will increase, and you will automatically reach out to a lot of potential clients.</p><p class=align-left>Many little brands have made their way to fame with the help of Instagram. And that too; by pushing behind much-reputed companies.</p><h3>2. Beyond conventional audience engagement</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhsanh49bagttc.jpeg><p class=align-left>You gain customers by engaging with them. It is one of the core tools needed to boost your business. Even a costly marketing campaign will fail to flourish if you are unable to make big levels of audience engagement.</p><p class=align-left>A survey done by Forrester Research shows that Instagram beasts Facebook and Twitter by providing 58 times and 150 times more audience engagement as compared to Facebook and Twitter respectively.</p><h3>3. Marketing made visual</h3><p class=align-left>Among all the different kinds of advertising and marketing tools there is, visual medium is the most productive one. So, if you are running a brand and relying on plain texts, you are missing out on the successful perspective.</p><p class=align-left>Instagram is successful because of the fact that it uses the visual marketing technique. When you have something to show, you have got to do it; and trust me, people like to see almost everything. If you are putting up appropriate content, your brand will automatically push its way up.</p><h3>4. Easy marketing</h3><p class=align-left>You may just give up at one point in time because producing new followers is not a really easy task, but you need to be patient. Customers are already taken over by advertisements on other social media and TV. That is why your content needs to be original. Let your entire team help, if necessary; but get your content right and it will boost your followers' list.</p><p class=align-left>People like stories, so make sure your concept reaches out to the public in that level.</p><p class=align-left>Be careful. The want for new followers may lead many like us towards illegal ways such as Instagram followers hack tools and tricks. It can lead you to serious trouble. Moreover, Instagram has lately gotten stricter with their policies, and if you are trying to hack your account for more followers, and it will violate their standards, your account could get a straightforward ban. I don’t think either of us wants that to happen.
