<time>17 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/katsina-for-buhari-960x600.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>The special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on media and publicity, Femi Adesina has submitted that his principal has gained more popularity and acceptance among Nigerians even than some of the founding fathers of the nation.</h2><p>This is as he boasted that no Nigerian politician, dead or alive has the kind of magnetic effect Buhari has on Nigerians.</p><p>Adesina made the submission via an article released on his Facebook page on Thursday which he titled ‘THE ESSENTIAL BUHARI: VP OSINBAJO GOT IT!’</p><p>The presidential media aide in the article, agreed with the position of <strong>Vice President Yemi Osinbajo</strong> that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>it would be difficult</a></strong> to find any other politician in Nigeria as popular as President Buhari.</p><p>Taking the school of thought further, Adesina in the Facebook post said he has personally experienced the love, loyalty, and dedication Buhari enjoys from Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion, or age which no other politician past or present can boast of.</p><p>He said without adding any form of sycophancy to his declared position, no other Nigerian politician has the kind of public appeal Buhari generates.</p><p>Adesina wrote: “Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is an honest man. Whatever he tells you, please take it serious. You can even take it to the bank, as it’s a cheque that will never bounce.</p><p>“There may be a tendency to say; what else do you expect a number 2 man to say of his principal? He won’t excoriate or flagellate him in public, and because he may possibly need his support for the number one position at a time in the future, so he would say sugary things.</p><p>“For a typical politician, ambitious, cold, calculating, scheming, yes. But those of us who work with the duo know that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is not in that mould. He is honest, factual, totally dependent on God for whatever the future holds. Nothing is a matter of life and death, and so he could have chosen to keep quiet about the attributes of the President, so that he wouldn’t be misconstrued.</p><p>“When he said Buhari was possibly Nigeria’s most popular politician that we have had in generations, I believe it, not just by the hearing of the ear, but because my eyes have seen it.</p><p>“I am old enough to have seen our colorful and even swashbuckling politicians in action. I have seen the great Obafemi Awolowo. The charismatic Nnamdi Azikiwe (Zik of Africa). Shehu Shagari. Amino Kano. M.K.O Abiola. Bashir Tofa, and many others in action. But I have not seen anyone with the kind of attraction, magnetic pull, that Muhammadu Buhari has. And that is round the country, north and south. People swarm round him as bees do to honey.</p><p>‘No Nigerian leader, dead or alive, can match Buhari’s public appeal’</p><p>“I have been round the country with the President. I have also been to several countries of the world with him. I have not seen any other Nigerian leader, past or present, with his kind of allure, pull, fascination, magnetism. And that is why VP Osinbajo is right to have described him as possibly “the most popular Nigerian politician that we ever had in this generation.”</p><p>He went ahead to cite an example of how Nigerians have publicly shown their love and admiration for President Buhari despite what those in the opposition may want the public to believe about his personality.</p><p>“I remember that day in August 2017, when the President returned to the country finally from his medical vacation. From January of that year, he had been in and out a couple of times, but spending weeks and months outside, attending to his health,” he recalled in the article.</p><p>“And finally on August 19, he returned home, triumphantly. We were at the airport to receive him. I have told the story a number of times, to dispel the idiocy that it was a certain Jibril of Sudan that came back, and not Buhari. The daughter of the immediate past Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Gabriel Olonisakin, was getting married. And I had attended both the church service and reception, decked in full Yoruba traditional attire of Agbada and a cap to match. Straight from the ceremony, I went to the airport to join the welcome party for the President.</p><p>“We the principal aides were on a line to receive the President as he descended from the aircraft. And he shook hands with each person, having one wisecrack or the other to say, as is typical of him. When he got to me, he said, “Adesina, this is the best I’ve seen you dressed.” And we both laughed.<br>Jibril of Sudan? How did he know I was Adesina? How would he know how I normally dressed? Idiocy, I say again. But that is just a digression, not the story I really want to tell to support the topic at hand.</p><p>“We entered the vehicles lined up, and the convoy moved. It was perhaps the longest journey I’d ever witnessed from the airport to the town. Where did they come from? Like locusts, they swarmed onto the road, at many times forcing the convoy into a crawl. I didn’t know that such huge population resided in the communities along the airport road.</p><p>“Not induced or procured in any way, the people trooped out in their thousands to welcome the President back home. Multitude of ordinary Nigerians, the ones bearing the brunt of whatever was happening in the country then. They came onto the roads, waving, cheering, heralding the man they loved back into the country. Many times, the convoy was forced to a dead slow, until the President had to wave at them, and they cheered uproariously.<br>It took double or triple the normal time, before we could get to the Presidential Villa.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BuZputmJa%2FqnnMqKmeZaCkvba4wKtkraCRo3qvusCmm6Jlka%2B2rLXWnmSompGbsq61jJquqKSfrLxurc2dZJqlmaPCbrfAp6ZmnpWitm6tw56qoqaRZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbuhari-more-popular-than-nnamdi-azikiwe-obafemi-awolowo-and-aminu-kano-femi-adesina.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./former-gov-osunbor-issues-warning-to-ganduje-ahead-of-edo-gubernatorial-election.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./former-gov-osunbor-issues-warning-to-ganduje-ahead-of-edo-gubernatorial-election.html>Former Gov, Osunbor Issues Warning To Ganduje Ahead Of Edo Gubernatorial Election</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kara-robinson-now.html>Where Is Kara Robinson Now?
