he is very proud of the significant development that has taken place in this state; God willing, by the time of the end of his administration, he will leave Nigeria more united, prosperous, and secured than he found it,” Gambari said on behalf of the Nigerian leader.</p><h2>NASENI Impact</h2><p>In his remark earlier, the Executive Vice Chairman of NASENI, Prof. <strong>Mohammed Haruna,</strong> said the institute was one of the six approved by the president in 2021, one per political zone to guarantee food security and apply modern tools and equipment for mechanized agriculture.</p><p>According to him, the institute would guarantee technology for food processing, food preservation and application of food availability and artificial intelligence for efficient and multi-crop seasons.</p><p>Haruna said NASENI was collaborating with partners from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Czech Republic, and Italy to equip the institute and five others in the country with state-of-the-earth research and manufacturing facilities, targeting the best and the highest technology in the world.</p><p>“Science, technology, and innovation have always been the source of development and prosperity of all nations.<br>“The yardstick of measuring the willingness and readiness of Nigeria to transit from a community-based economy to a manufacturing economy is the degree to which NASENI’s role is applied to all aspects of our socio-economic endeavour,” Haruna noted.</p><p>Prof. Haruna expressed gratitude to President Buhari, Gov Abdullahi, and the Emir of Lafia, Justice<strong> Sidi Bage</strong>, for their generosity, guidance, and support, leading to the success achieved in the construction of the Institute.</p><p>“You will recall that foundation laying ceremony was performed in August; despite the volume of rain in September and October, we have been able to fence the 20 hectares of land, construct a gatehouse, roads, the administrative block, and the two workshops are about 90 per cent completion.</p><p>“God willing, it will be ready for commissioning between January and February 2023; with this development, all that is needed for modern farming in food processing, packing, and preservation are to be locally produced by NASENI.<br>“NASENI is among the best legacy that President Muhammadu Buhari will bequeath to the next and subsequent administration in Nigeria,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZq2glaeybsPIpaNmmpVisq%2B71KCfZp6fpLFuss6rZKehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSbnZakv6Z5yGafmqaUpMOmvoybrKGZop58</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthere-will-be-enough-food-for-nigerians-before-i-handover-buhari.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fetty-wap-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fetty-wap-html.html>Fetty Wap - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./atiku-abubakar.html>Read All The Latest News About Atiku Abubakar On Naija News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./atiku-abubakar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
