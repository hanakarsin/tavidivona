Though, the police took her to the hospital, it was rather futile.</p><p>The source revealed that Forester was sponsored abroad by one Mercy who is suspected to be trafficking&nbsp; Nigerian girls&nbsp; on the promise that she would assist them&nbsp; with&nbsp; decent jobs in Russia. The teenager&nbsp; without hesitation, but with the approval of her mother jumped at the offer with high hopes.</p><p>According to the deceased’s elder sister, Sonia Samson, they got a call from&nbsp; Mercy, on Tuesday March 4,&nbsp; 2014 that Forester had died in an inferno. She added that the family was later told that Forester was stabbed before being set ablaze.</p><p>Sonia said,&nbsp; “Her madam is the one that called us on Tuesday and told us she was locked in a room and set ablaze by some unknown Russians. She told us that she was rushed to the hospital, that they were treating her.</p><p>“Later that day, she also told us that she was initially stabbed before she was burnt. Not too long after, she told us that she was dead. The madam said she was not the only victim in the attack. She said there were five other Nigerians, that another one died four or&nbsp; five days after the attack.</p><p>“My sister died mysteriously, just as another sister of mine was also killed by&nbsp; armed robbers. Sincerely, I am confused because I don’t know why all this is happening to us. Particularly for me, it is so painful that I don’t really know what to say or do. This is a difficult time for the family and I believe we need to be more prayerful more than ever before.”</p><p>The late Forester, who would have been celebrating&nbsp; her 18th&nbsp; birthday on March 30&nbsp; hails from Igbekhue in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State. She completed her secondary education&nbsp; in 2013.</p><p>Forester’s father, Friday Osazuwa&nbsp; Samson was killed four years ago in Benin by suspected armed robbers. He was shot in broad daylight in front of his shop at Upper Sakponba. Until Friday’s death, he was a successful businessman, a distributor&nbsp; with Sona and Bendel breweries.</p><p>Siblings and other relatives of the late Forester’s father are worried and pained by circumstances surrounding how Forester was lured into traveling to Russia, which they described as shady. Recognizing the fact that she did not travel to Russia for further education, even as they were not also informed of such plans, they are calling on concerned authorities to wade into the matter.</p><p>They are accusing Mercy of human trafficking and&nbsp; calling on National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) to investigate the activities of this said Mercy. They also want the Nigerian Embassy in Russia to as a matter of urgency unravel the mystery surrounding the death of their daughter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Forester’s uncle, Mr Saturday Samson Osazuwa accused Forester’s mother of conniving with the said madam (Mercy) to deceive and persuade the teenager to travel abroad. He queried why Forester’s mother, Elizabeth, decided to hide his niece’s whereabouts from him. Saturday, who now acts as a father figure to the children since their father’s death, said the mother refused to disclose where Forester was, even as he insisted on seeing her.</p><p>Said he: “The mother was aware that Forester had traveled abroad. Not just that,&nbsp; I believe she was part of the arrangement that her 17-year-old daughter&nbsp; should&nbsp; travel abroad. It is really unfortunate and wicked of her to have taken that decision.</p><p>“If my brother, her husband was alive, he would never allow such a thing for any of&nbsp; his children. What was Forester looking for in Russia? Was it to go there and school? Certainly not. Now, she has caused the entire family pain and sorrow. The girl was beautiful and intelligent. I still cannot understand what she was sent to Russia to do at her tender age.</p><p>His words: “What exactly will Forester be doing&nbsp; abroad when she was supposed to be studying at the University of Benin or any other higher institution of learning in Nigeria? What she did is unacceptable to every member of our family.”</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3KFkWploaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f61921-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./415194-rais-wa-ufaransa-macron-aahidi-kuendelea-kusalimia-licha-ya-kupigwa-kofi-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./415194-rais-wa-ufaransa-macron-aahidi-kuendelea-kusalimia-licha-ya-kupigwa-kofi-html.html>Rais wa Ufaransa Aahidi Kuendelea Kusalimia Watu Licha ya Kuchanjwa Kofi Usoni</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ekweremadu-clears-the-air-about-joining-labour-party-after-dumping-pdp-guber-ambition.html>Ekweremadu Clears The Air About Joining Labour Party After Dumping PDP Guber Ambition</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ekweremadu-clears-the-air-about-joining-labour-party-after-dumping-pdp-guber-ambition.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
