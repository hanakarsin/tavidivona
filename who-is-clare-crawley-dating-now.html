The couple got engaged on the show before Tayshia Adams took over as the lead, and it seemed like Clare had finally found her person.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, Dale and Clare first parted ways in early 2021, and after a brief reconciliation, they broke up for good in the fall of 2021. It appears as if Dale has since moved on, as he's been linked to businesswoman/designer Galey Alix (née Gravenstein). Clare also moved on as well, and about a month after going public with beau Ryan Dawkins, she has confirmed that she is engaged.</p><p>Read on to find out the latest in Clare and Dale's current love lives.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Clare Crawley dating now?</h2><p>About a year after her relationship with Dale ended for good, Clare has found a connection with a new beau. The former Bachelorette confirmed that she was in a relationship on Sept. 6 when she shared a video with a mystery man on her Instagram feed.</p><p>In the clip, Clare and her boyfriend sang along to the Chris Brown and Yung Thug song, "Go Crazy," in the car together.</p><p>"Him," she captioned the video, along with a pink heart emoji.</p><p>Though Clare didn't share her boyfriend's name at the time, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that the 41-year-old is in a relationship with Ryan Dawkins.</p><p>According to the source, Clare and Ryan became friends about a year before they went official on social media. They began dating several months before they went public, but Clare wanted to wait to share the news with her followers until they had "built a real, solid foundation."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Clare Crawley (@clarecrawley)</a></p></figure><p>The insider also shared that Ryan is a dad, and that he isn't dating the reality star to get in the spotlight.</p><p>"He's mature, career-driven and a good father," the source said about the 47-year-old. "He isn't in it for fame, which is what makes him different from her past relationships."</p><p>Per the outlet, Ryan is the CEO of Mascot Sports, which is a marketing agency.</p><p>Before Clare went official with Ryan, she was linked to former Bachelorette contestant, Blake Monar, and to comedian, Jeff Dye. Neither romance was ever confirmed, and the lead has clearly moved on with Ryan.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Clare Crawley and Ryan Dawkins announced their engagement in October of 2022.</h2><p>Just over a month after they confirmed their relationship, Ryan and Clare announced their engagement.
