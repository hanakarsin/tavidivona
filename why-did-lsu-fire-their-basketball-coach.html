And one of the Level I violations alleges that Wade made “impermissible cash payments to the former fiancée of a student-athlete in order to buy her silence regarding prior and current impermissible inducements to student-athletes or prospective student-athletes.”</p><p>In another accusation, the NCAA alleges that Wade made payments to an individual with sway on where a prospect would play college basketball — and that he “directed that payments be made to [the individual] from a bank account in the name of Wade’s spouse that Wade and his spouse treated as a joint account.”</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In their letter, Tate and Woodward said that Wade’s firing is “not an acknowledgement of agreement with any of the allegations,” vowing that the school will conduct “an exhaustive and objective examination of the relevant facts and applicable NCAA regulations.”</p><p>The university also terminated the contract for associate men’s basketball Bill Armstrong, who is accused of one Level I violation and one Level II violation.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>“We can no longer subject our University, Department of Athletics, and — most importantly — our student-athletes, to this taxing and already lengthy process without taking action,” Tate and Woodward wrote. “Our responsibility to protect and promote the integrity and well-being of our entire institution and our student-athletes will always be paramount.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kevin Nickelberry became LSU’s interim coach after Wade’s ouster.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kevin Nickelberry (@kevin.nickelberry)</a></p></figure><p>Kevin Nickelberry, who was <a href=#>Howard University</a>’s head men’s basketball coach for nearly a decade before becoming assistant coach at LSU, is filling in as interim coach for the rest of the Tigers’ season.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Nickelberry learned about his new position in a meeting with Tate and Woodward on Saturday. Three minutes later, he had to address the team. “What I told the players in that first meeting was, all we can control is the next week — or, I hope, two or three weeks,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a> last week. “None of us knows what’s coming after that. Some guys will graduate. Some will have a shot at the NBA. Some will be auditioning — for the new coach here or for a coach at another school.”</p><p>He went on: “What I wanted them to understand was that we are a very good basketball team and to play in the NCAA tournament is an opportunity that may or may not come again. Nothing’s guaranteed. I told them I understood this was a unique and extraordinary circumstance. But we had five days to get our mojo back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ako6p6p7XRnmStoJWev26uwKyinqySlrmtecKomJyg</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-lsu-fire-their-basketball-coach.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marc-gomez-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marc-gomez-html.html>Marc Gomez - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./biafra-nigeria-was-never-created-to-move-forward-simon-ekpa.html>Biafra: Nigeria Was Never Created To Move Forward</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./biafra-nigeria-was-never-created-to-move-forward-simon-ekpa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
