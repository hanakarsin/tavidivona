He benefitted from this party and it is bad that he is encouraging Governors Nyesom Wike, Makinde, Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi and Ortom to behave the way they are doing. He knows these five governors are fighting his cause.</p><p>“We got so convinced about this when the Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed, brought in his own angle to it. That was unnecessary and we all know that Bala is the closest northern politician to Jonathan whether in power or not.</p><p>“So, what the party has resolved to do, among others, is to send a powerful delegation to the former president to plead with him to intervene. The delegation is not going to accuse the former president but merely plead with him to forgive Atiku because we already know what is brewing underground.</p><p>“For instance, today (yesterday), Wike and his colleagues are (were) in Bauchi. Do we need any prophet to tell us what they are up to? We know where they are coming from, but they will all fail.”</p><p>The source, however, stated that the five aggrieved Governors can not hold PDP at ransom ahead of the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The source added, “There are so many routes to any market, so if these five governors think they can hold us to ransom, they have failed. We have put in place enough measures to circumvent their antics in what looks like an effective shadowing so that they will not sabotage us.</p><p>“Already, the party’s Board of Trustees has tentatively approved that all concerned chapters are fortified with a focus on certain personalities who have influence in their various states. And when the time comes, Nigerians will know that the G-5 or whatever you call them are a powerless minority.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BpZrChm5p6o63LmmSmp5iWuq6xw2amraCVp8BurdGeZJ%2Bhl53BqrrGZqGoppGptaK60maamq2jmnqxsM9mo56ZlJq%2FtHnTqGSppJWWsW6yzqtkn6einLa3sc2eqqxlo6TCs6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwike-bala-mohammed-others-are-fighting-jonathans-cause-pdp-leaders-to-plead-for-forgiveness-source.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bobrisky-former-pa-oye-reminisce-on-past-sexcapades-exposes-things-they-did-together.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bobrisky-former-pa-oye-reminisce-on-past-sexcapades-exposes-things-they-did-together.html>Bobrisky Former PA, Oye Reminisce On Past Sexcapades, Exposes Things They Did Together</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-do-people-steal-catalytic-converters.html>Why Do People Steal Catalytic Converters?
