They have given time, energy, money, heart and soul to keep the dream going for the past 4 years. We believe that those who WORK the land should reap the benefits and the little that we had was being put away to open new spots and create other opportunities for co-ownership. Obviously, things have changed, but we press on. UVK operated in direct response to what the founding member felt was, at the time, the almost non existent POC representation in the vegan restaurant scene. We celebrate our culture loudly, even though in the beginning it was suggested we "tone it down" so people wouldn't feel "alienated". We were even told we put two words in our name that were a "no-no"- Vegan and Urban, we were told it would 'turn people off". We said fuck that, it's who we are and we don't roll like that. We wanted to people to FEEL who we are so we play the music we play and we put the photos we want on the walls, and if they want to walk out they could, and they have, but the ones that stayed are family. We wanted to create an environment where POC could feel like they were home and where people of all races and orientations also felt welcomed and included. Because usually it's the other way around, most vegan spots where not created BY US or for US and we always felt like we were in someone else's party. That's not to say we didn't like them or liked hanging in them, but it never felt like HOME. But that is changing, more and more spots are catering to brown and black people, we hope we had a little something to do with that. Don't let anyone fool you, we have been outsiders since DAY 1 in this vegan world for MANY reasons. But like many of our heroes we also never wanted to use our POC status as a crutch because that is not strength, instead we want to celebrate who we are and where we come from. Our strength is LOVE, our ammunition is KNOWLEDGE and FOOD is our weapon, please come and USE it!</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>UVK</a> (@urbanvegankitchen) on Jun 6, 2020 at 5:55am PDT</p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Urban Vegan Kitchen</a> is co-owned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Elizabeth</a>, a Black chef who owns eight restaurants across New York City, including the famous vegan <a href=# rel=noopener>Blossom</a> restaurants.
