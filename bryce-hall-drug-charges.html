More than 100 people were in attendance, and videos of the gathering showed guests not wearing masks while standing shoulder-to-shoulder inside and outside their home.</p><p>It was around 4 a.m. when the party was finally broken up. According to influencer drama account @DefNoodles on Twitter, the boys were fined over $30,000 in various charges for the party.</p><p>DefNoodles also claims that part of Bryce's bail agreement was that he would not engage in any illegal activity, and his Aug. 15 party potentially violated those terms.</p><p>"Texas DA’s office confirmed they are closely looking at revoking Bryce Hall’s bail for drug-related arrest in May because conditions of Bryce’s bail demand that he does not engage illegal or immoral activities," he tweeted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>5.

"They are actively looking at revoking Bryce and Jaden’s bail, and arresting and extraditing them to Texas."</p><p>While nothing has been confirmed yet, this means Bryce could be looking at jail time in his immediate future, depending on what the Texas DA decides. Jaden Hossler, who was arrested with Bryce, may face similar consequences.</p><p>At this time, there is no definitive answer as to whether Bryce will be going to jail, though it's possible. The city of Los Angeles <a href=#>shut off water and power</a> to one of the Sway House's two homes in response to their party, as the city's mayor had promised to do to anyone violating the current pandemic guidelines.</p><p>According to @DefNoodles, the boys have also been threatened with eviction from their homes once eviction bans in Los Angeles are lifted.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
